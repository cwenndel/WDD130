    <h2> Wenndel Santos</h2>
    <p> My name's Wenndel and I am from Brazil, my hobbies are to play soccer and chess.</p>
    <p> I am studying Web and Computer Programming, currently I am working as a planning analyst.</p>
    <p> I have been a member of the Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints since 2006, it's wonderful to be part of this church. One of my favorite scripture is 1 Nephi 17:51 "And now if the Lord has such great power, and has wrought so many miracles among the children of men, how is it that he cannot instruct me, that i should build a ship" this scripture helps me to trust in our Heavenly Father when I face challenge or when I have to do something hard. In 2010 I had the opportunity to serve a full time mission in Brazil Brazilia. I got married in 2016 with Stephany and we have a beautiful daughter, her name is Ester.</p>
