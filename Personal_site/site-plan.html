      <h3>interactivity</h3>
      <p>
        Dashboards offer a dynamic experience, where information can be filtered and manipulated to highlight changes over time, achieved results, and potential threats that can impact the company. With this interactivity, it's possible to access few or many data points based on a given time frame. It's also important to have an analytical view to understand the generated information and make decisions for improving the company.

      <h3>Acess to data for decision making</h3>
      <p>
        A dashboard brings together multiple data sources in a single interface. This means that you can have a detailed overview of your business in real-time. By doing so, you reduce the time needed to compile reports, saving time and resources. Once the Dashboard is implemented, it will require monitoring so that the data presents real information on the overall performance of the company, but also of each department, in order to be able to interact between the areas of the company.
